# --New ranks--
-->Each rank will come with more things they are allowed for,Such as if theu are Patched III they are able to have thier own teams they are in charge 
to make packs for the club and orders
-->Must Reach atleast Patched II before being able to apply for Officer positions in the club.
-->A Senior Patched member is a trusted member who is held to high standards. this role is in charge of all Patched members. ensuring they are handling thier teams
properly and to take complaints and guide prospects and patched members 
		
# --New Task Force--
-->SGTAtArms will now have a specialized task force. The SGTAtArms will choose 4 people who they deem the best "Shooters" in SOA and they will be our 
"Sliders". The club will stop sliding on other gangs unless special permission from SGTAtArms+.This doesnt mean you cant defend yourself if you are 
Being shot at! The 4 that are on the task force will also be assigned to be the higherup personal bodyguards. these will be assigned to road captain+
this is a very exclusive task force and you must be a trusted member and a good shot.
	If you feel like you deserve a spot on the SGTAtArms task force, then prove it! post clips of your kills, in the clips channel and good luck!

--> If you are in city, you are required to be in the emails and to do a check in. if you fail to do a check-in you will be considered inactive, failing to message us on 
why you are inactive will result in 2 strikes. you can appeal these strikes through the VP/President if you provide a valid reason for being "inactive" these can only 
be appealed once every 3 weeks. additionally, you must stay in the respective channels. if you are doing legals you are required to be in the legals channel, if you 
are doing coke you are required to be in the coke channel and so on. this is to help leviate confusion and help us communicate effeciently
