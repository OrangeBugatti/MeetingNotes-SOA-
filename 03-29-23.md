# AutoShop
  to assist in the pay for the autoshop the current gun orders will be used for the purchase of the bodyshops.
  additionally all members will be required to give 40k to help make the purchase.
    All higher-ups will be paying 500k towards this purchase aswell.
    
    Operations inside the shop will be a non-club function. under no circumstances will any member of SOA
    be allowed to enter the property of the bodyshop while wearing the cut. 
    
# The new pack system
   The new pack making system is as so:
       
    The concept of "Personal Packs" will no longer be a thing. All members are required to give into a stockpile of packs 
    in efforts to make gun sales more effecient and faster. for example 1 single 100 Glock order will result in 1.7 million in clean cash.
    this money will then be split up to those who, 
    -Provide the packs
    -Sell the packs
    -Gun runs.
        To do this, we have set up several stash houses for members to "check out" the packs or dirty with a higher-up, this will 
        eliminate people stealing packs and other things from peoples house inventory that is meant for gun orders.
